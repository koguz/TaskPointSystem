    <p class="mb-0">
      TPS has been in use since the 2016-2017 Spring semester.
      It was used as a process on online services such as Trello and Asana in the 
      "SE315 Software Project Management" course in Izmir University of Economics, 
      and the results have been presented at a national conference (Oguz and Gül, 2017). 
      The following semester, it was implemented as a standalone web application using Django. 
      Since then, it has been an integral part of the 
      "SE302 Principles of Software Engineering" course and other courses such as 
      "CE216 Fundamental Topics in Programming."
