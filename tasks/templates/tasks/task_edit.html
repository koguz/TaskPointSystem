<p><b>Description</b>: Make sure you provide a clear description of the task. Let your team understand the task, so that they can comment on it. </p>
<p><b>Priority</b>: This should be "Planned" most of the time. "Urgent" is reserved for the tasks that are running late; for example, a bug has been found and you have to fix it immediately. "Low" is reserved for the tasks that were not required, but now that you have time you want to work on it. </p>
<p><b>Promised Date</b>: This is the date you promise to complete your task; if it is not complete <i>the day after this date</i>, then the task will be rejected. Beware, once the due date for the milestone passes({{milestone.due}}), all tasks that are not complete are rejected. </p>
